# Evolutionary Algorithms
EA (Evolutionary Algorithms) are a type of optimization algorithms which uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, selection, mutation and recombination. The general idea behind evolutionary algorithms is to start with a population of candidate solutions to a problem and then apply the operators like mutation, reproduction, etc to generate new solutions, hoping that the quality of solutions will improve over time. The fitness of an individual is defined by how well it solves the problem in the end. The individuals with best fitness have a higher probability of getting selected for reproduction. The reproduction process involves creating new individuals by combining the traits of two or more selected individuals. This is done through crossover (swapping or combining genetic information) and mutation (introducing small random changes to an individual's genetic information). This process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found or a stopping criterion is met. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity (fitness function evaluation) is a prohibiting factor.
